<span class = "initial">"R</span>eader, My name is **Kalpaj Chaudhari** and I'm a student who doesn't like to study, just like everybody else. I started this blog over my failure of something I don't know a thing about. But over time, I plan to learn it and do it. I like to be with people who appreciate that there is more to life than just spending there time at home. I love going out with friends, making stuff work for my android device. You can have a look at my [xda-profile](http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=5906831) and get to know about my contributions.

##Gist!

Sometime ago, I read somewhere that we should be able to appreciate everything about the world. But I'm only human. Sometimes I feel that things should have gone differently. But as time passes by, I have come to appreciate the downsides and let go of things."
