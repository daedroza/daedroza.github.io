<span class = "initial">"R</span>eader, My name is **Kalpaj Chaudhari** and I'm a student who doesn't like to study. Just like everybody else. I started this blog over my failure of something I don't know a thing about. But over time, I plan to learn it and do it. I like to be with people, who appreciate that there is more to life than just spending there time at home. I might be a little weird, because I like summer season. I simply love the heat outside! I also love working on my android-device. I share what I find about this on my xda-dev: forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=5906831."

##Gist!
I read that we should be able to appreciate everything about the world. But I'm only human. Sometimes I feel that things should have gone differently. But as time passes by, I have come to appreciate the downsides and let go of things! But if you feel if I was ever wrong about something or maybe wanted to chat with me, then you can contact me at daedroza@gmail.com
