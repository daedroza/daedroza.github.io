After being frustated from merging thermal commits for kernel_apq8064 from different sources, I thought I give blogging a try. I'm having holiday season, so I took a challenge to put a static blog with no database(due to hosting issues). Jekyll perfectly seemed to do the job and here we are! My very first blog!
