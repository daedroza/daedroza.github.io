After being frustated from merging thermal commits for kernel_apq8064 from different sources, I thought I give blogging a try. I'm having holiday season, so I took a challenge to put a static blog with no database(due to hosting issues). Jekyll perfectly seemed to do the job and here we are! My very first blog!

You can read the whole documentation [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs]. If you gave it a try and found something buggy, then file them here [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
