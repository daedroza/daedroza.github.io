 After being frustated from merging thermal commits for kernel_apq8064 from different sources, I thought I give blogging a try. I am having holiday season, so instead of going easy pre-built editor ones I used Jekyll. Plus, it's awesome.

You can read the whole documentation @[Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs]. If you gave it a try and found something buggy, then file them here @[Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
