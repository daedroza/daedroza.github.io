The day is about to end and alot has happened over since this day from last year. My year in engineering had everything I ever wanted, all the ups and down. Variety is the spice of life, now I'm sure. 

I made a lot of friends in Semester 1 and Semester 2. Some I lost, but some even came closer. My only wish is that we could all go out more. I have learned to be myself in front of them, you guys are the best! And Happy Birthday Shreya, God bless you!

Learned a lot, from Vlad and George about Android Development. I want to thank them. I had my longshot on CM kernel. Really, it's too hard to get things done when you don't have enough knowledge. I tried my best and I keep trying to add new stuff, probably ended up in denials, but who cares? I managed it.

Tomorrow, a new fresh start. Probably a new work-out routine, making new friends and learning new things, that's the plan!
